"*Cedars-Sinai does not have a standard cash price for inpatient services because each patient's specific medical and financial situation is different. If you are uninsured, the price you will pay for inpatient care at Cedars-Sinai will depend on the services you need and the amount of financial assistance you qualify for under our general financial assistance policy.   Although there are no standard cash prices for inpatient services, if you are uninsured and would like information on rates for services, please contact Patient Financial Services at 866-803-1777. We're committed to providing quality healthcare to everyone in the community who needs it. This includes offering full financial assistance or services at discounted prices to eligible people who cannot afford to pay for part or all of their care. Payment plans are also available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
